After weighing different approaches we decided we wanted to try and implement something similar to his third character identification network, using context within a word to help determine the identity of a character. This could be tricky, as in some cases we want the pixel imputs to have most sway and in other cases we want the surrounding characters to be the determining factor. \n",
